Problem 112
===========

Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an
increasing number; for example, 134468.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number;
for example, 66420.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number;
for example, 155349.

As n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such that there are only 12951
numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10^10.

How many numbers below a googol (10^100) are not bouncy?
