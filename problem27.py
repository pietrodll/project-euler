Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula: n^2 + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values
0 <= n <= 39. However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40 * (40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and
certainly when n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n^2 - 79 * n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the
consecutive values 0 <= n <= 79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form: n^2 + a * n + b, where abs(a) < 1000 and abs(b) < 1000

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the
maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.

# As the formula must give a prime number for n = 0, it means that b must be a prime number
# If n = b, the result is divisible by b, which means that n varies between 0 and b - 1
# Depending on the value of a, the maximum value of the formula can be b (with n = 0)
